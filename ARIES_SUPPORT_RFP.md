# Introduction & Instructions

## Purpose of the RFP

Alaska DHSS DPA is searching for a partner to support the ongoing
maintenance of the public assistance eligibility system. This system
currently processes eligibility for MAGI Medicaid but is growing to
support all existing public assistance programs. This system has over
400 internal users, an externally facing self-service portal, a
connection to the federally facilitated healthcare marketplace, and
currently issues MAGI Medicaid for over 200,000 Alaskans. An interested
partner will work closely with State of Alaska technical and business
staff to ensure the eligibility system is:

-   Performing correctly and efficiently

-   Meeting applicable security requirements

-   Compliant with Federal and state regulations

-   Is available for staff use

-   Appropriately documented

## Budget

The Department of Health and Social Services, Division of Public
Assistance (DPA) has a maximum budget of \$7,200,000.00 for completion
of this initial contract period (two (2) years). The State may choose to
exercise three (3) annual renewal options anticipated to be valued at
\$3,600,000.00 annually. If the full five (5) year term is executed the
value is estimated to be \$18,000,000.00. Approval or continuation of a
contract or any additionally identified services is contingent upon
legislative appropriation.

Proposals priced at more than the maximum budget for the initial
contract period (\$7,200,000.00) or higher than the total possible
estimated contract amount (\$18,000,000.00) will be considered
non-responsive.

## Deadline for Receipt of Proposals

Proposals must be received no later than 2:00 pm prevailing Alaska Time
on TBD.

Late proposals or amendments will be disqualified and not opened or
accepted for evaluation.

## Minimum Qualifications

In order for offers to be considered responsive, offerors must meet the
following minimum prior experience requirements. Please ensure start and
end dates (month and year) are indicated, and that experience is
detailed sufficiently to ensure verification of all aspects of the
minimums below.


- Contractor must have a minimum of three (3) years' experience in 
the last five (5) years, conducting Health and Human Services    
system support operations services. This experience must include 
maintenance and updates of an enterprise technology system       

- These updates must include configuration updates and software    
development updates                                              

- Demonstrated experience with similar technologies at an          
enterprise scale                                                 

An offeror's failure to meet these minimum prior experience
requirements will cause their proposal to be considered non-responsive
and rejected.

## Required Review

Offerors should carefully review this solicitation for defects and
questionable or objectionable material. Comments concerning defects and
questionable or objectionable material should be made in writing and
received by the procurement officer at least ten days before the
deadline for receipt of proposals. This will allow time for the issuance
of any necessary amendments. It will also help prevent the opening of a
defective proposal and exposure of offeror\'s proposals upon which award
could not be made.

## Questions Prior to Deadline for Receipt of Proposals

Questions or comments regarding this RFP shall be submitted as issues
within this RFP\'s GitHub repository no later than 12 noon on TBD, to
allow the State sufficient time to respond. All questions and comments
will be publicly available. Please subscribe to the repository if your
firm would like updates about changes and comments. Questions or
comments received after the required deadline may not be answered.

Questions may also be submitted in writing to the Procurement Officer,
who will post them as issues with the GitHub repository listed above.

Two types of questions generally arise. One may be answered by directing
the questioner to a specific section of the RFP. Other questions may be
more complex and may require a written amendment to the RFP. The
procurement officer will make that decision.

#  Background Information

## Background Information

Alaska Administrative Code (AAC) 7 designates the Department of Health
and Social Services (DHSS) as having responsibility for administering
the Food Stamp, Adult Public Assistance, Medical Assistance, Heating
Assistance, Alaska Temporary Assistance and General Relief programs.

As a part of this designation, the DHSS Division of Public Assistance
(DPA) is charged with determining eligibility for each of the programs
based on State and Federal regulation.

To perform this work, DPA uses several technical systems. These include
a legacy mainframe system, as well as a modern MAGI Medicaid
determination platform. This system is used by over 400 eligibility
technicians, administrative staff, and management personnel within DPA.
In addition to these users there are multiple community partners that
access the system to assist in the public assistance program
administration.

The MAGI Medicaid eligibility system is based on an IBM WebSphere
software platform utilizing Microsoft Servers currently hosted on the
State of Alaska virtual infrastructure.

The system communicates with multiple Federal and state partners to
transfer information and documentation.

DPA utilizes modern software delivery methods. We are user centric and
integrate security and privacy into all our maintenance and improvement
work. More information about our approach can be found at
<https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/EIS-Modernization/>

Offerors should review this repo for information that will be critical
in constructing a quality proposal.

**DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS**

Code deliverables shall be submitted via Git PRs to the ARIES
TFS/AzureDevOps repository. A copy of any document deliverables shall be
submitted to the Alaska technical team.

**INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF SERVICES**

All periodic reports and deliverables shall be inspected, tested (where
applicable), reviewed, and accepted by the Alaska technical team, prior
to sprint conclusion and deployment to the staging and production
environments.

Only the Alaska technical support team has the authority to inspect,
accept, or reject all deliverables.

Acceptance of services and deliverables will be based on the criteria
laid out in the quality acceptance plan. (Attachment 9 in the RFP
package)

**SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION**

The Contractor shall consult with the Alaska technical team to determine
what is appropriate, effective, and essential for system documentation.
The State requires, at a minimum, that the contractor will generate
comprehensive and complete documentation, both within the code itself,
within the source code version control system (e.g., through proper use
of descriptive commit messages, issue tracking, pull requests, etc.),
and as appropriate, in separate documentation, provide artifacts, and
create new user stories based on each sprint.

We typically house documentation in TFS or AzureDevOps either in the
built-in wiki, or as part of a repository. This allows the documents to
be versioned and controlled. We expect that the selected vendor will
create and update documentation using these standards where appropriate.

**QUALITY ASSURANCE**

The contractor shall comply with the acceptable quality levels (AQL) as
described in the attached quality assurance plan (QAP).

## Contract Type

This contract will be a time and materials contract with a do not exceed
amount.

## Proposed Payment Procedures

The state will make payments based on a negotiated payment schedule.
Each billing must consist of an invoice and progress report. No payment
will be made until the progress report and invoice has been approved by
the project director.

## Prompt Payment For State Purchases {#prompt-payment-for-state-purchases .3.0}

The state is eligible to receive a **5%** discount for all invoices paid
within **15** business days from the date of receipt of the commodities
or services and/or a correct invoice, whichever is later. The discount
shall be taken on the full invoice amount. The state shall consider
payment being made as either the date a printed warrant is issued or the
date an electronic funds transfer (EFT) is initiated.

## Contract Payment {#contract-payment .3.0}

No payment will be made until the contract is approved by the
Commissioner of the Department of Health and Social Services or the
Commissioner\'s designee. Under no conditions will the state be liable
for the payment of any interest charges associated with the cost of the
contract. The state is not responsible for and will not pay local,
state, or federal taxes. All costs associated with the contract must be
stated in U.S. currency.

Any single contract payment of \$1 million or higher must be accepted by
the contractor via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).

## Location of Work

The location(s) the work is to be performed, completed, and managed is
at the discretion of the contractor as long as the location complies
with the requirements listed below. The state will not provide workspace
for the contractor. The contractor must provide its own workspace.

We anticipate much of this work to be performed remotely with close
collaboration between the project team via digital communication
methods. There may be some occasions where an onsite visit is required,
but those will be the exception rather than the rule.

In the event where an on-site presence is requested, the following State
Approved Travel Guidelines apply

The State will cover costs associated with travel per the criteria
listed below. Expenses above these criteria must be approved in advance
by the Project Director.

-   **Air Travel**: copies of receipts and boarding passes for flights
    must be submitted with the invoice. The State will reimburse for
    coach travel only.

-   **Hotel**: copies of original hotel receipts at commercial
    facilities must be submitted with the invoice. Actual lodging
    expenses that exceed \$200 room rate per night, excluding taxes,
    must be approved in advance by the Program Manager.

-   **Rental Car**: copies of the rental car receipt and agreement must
    be submitted with the invoice. Rental should be for a mid-size or
    less car (unless approved in advance) and the rental period is to
    cover the business travel period only.

-   **Ground Transportation**: between the Contractor's home and the
    airport, and the destination airport and hotel; via airport shuttle,
    courtesy van, or taxi service.

-   **Per Diem**: the maximum amount for food and all other travel
    related incidentals in Alaska is \$60 per day, per person.

**Note**: Costs of parking violations will not be reimbursed

To facilitate this method of delivery and partnership it is critical
that a successful vendor align with the State of Alaska time zone. The
vendor's team must ensure their agile ceremonies are conducted at times
that are consistent with the State of Alaska's normal business hours
(8:00AM--5:00PM Alaska Standard Time). As a rule, staff should be
available during these times.

**Performance of Work Within United States**

By signature on their proposal, the offeror certifies that all services
provided under this contract by the contractor and all subcontractors
shall be performed in the United States.

If the offeror cannot certify that all work will be performed in the
United States, the offeror must contact the procurement officer in
writing to request a waiver at least 10 days prior to the deadline for
receipt of proposals.

The request must include a detailed description of the portion of work
that will be performed outside the United States, where, by whom, and
the reason the waiver is necessary.

Failure to comply with these requirements may cause the state to reject
the proposal as non-responsive or cancel the contract.

## Subcontractors

Subcontractors may be used to perform work under this contract. If an
offeror intends to use subcontractors, the offeror must identify in the
proposal the names of the subcontractors and the portions of the work
the subcontractors will perform.

Subcontractor experience shall not be considered in determining whether
the offeror meets the requirements set forth in Sec. 1.04: Minimum
Qualifications**.**

If a proposal with subcontractors is selected, the offeror must provide
the following information concerning each prospective subcontractor
within five working days from the date of the state\'s request:

-   complete name of the subcontractor;

-   complete address of the subcontractor;

-   type of work the subcontractor will be performing;

-   percentage of work the subcontractor will be providing;

-   evidence that the subcontractor holds a valid Alaska business
    license; and

-   a written statement signed by each proposed subcontractor that
    clearly verifies that the subcontractor is committed to render the
    services required by the contract.

An offeror\'s failure to provide this information, within the time set,
may cause the state to consider their proposal non-responsive and reject
it. The substitution of one subcontractor for another may be made only
at the discretion and prior written approval of the project director.

Note that if the subcontractor will not be performing work within
Alaska, they will not be required to hold an Alaska business license.

## Joint Ventures

Joint ventures will not be allowed.

## Right to Inspect Place of Business

At reasonable times, the state may inspect those areas of the
contractor\'s place of business that are related to the performance of a
contract. If the state makes such an inspection, the contractor must
provide reasonable assistance.

## Contract Personnel {#contract-personnel .3.0}

Any change of the key personnel or subcontractors named in the proposal
must be approved, in advance and in writing, by the project director.
Personnel changes that are not approved by the state may be grounds for
the state to terminate the contract.

## Inspection & Modification - Reimbursement For Unacceptable Deliverables {#inspection-modification---reimbursement-for-unacceptable-deliverables .3.0}

The contractor is responsible for the completion of all work set out in
the contract. All work is subject to inspection, evaluation, and
approval by the project director. The state may employ all reasonable
means to ensure that the work is progressing and being performed in
compliance with the contract. The project director may instruct the
contractor to make corrections or modifications if needed in order to
accomplish the contract's intent. The contractor will not unreasonably
withhold such changes.

Substantial failure of the contractor to perform the contract may cause
the state to terminate the contract. In this event, the state may
require the contractor to reimburse monies paid (based on the identified
portion of unacceptable work received) and may seek associated damages.

## Contract Changes - Unanticipated Amendments {#contract-changes---unanticipated-amendments .3.0}

During the course of this contract, the contractor may be required to
perform additional work. That work will be within the general scope of
the initial contract. When additional work is required, the project
director will provide the contractor a written description of the
additional work and request the contractor to submit a firm time
schedule for accomplishing the additional work and a firm price for the
additional work. Cost and pricing data must be provided to justify the
cost of such amendments per AS 36.30.400.

The contractor will not commence additional work until the project
director has secured any required state approvals necessary for the
amendment and issued a written contract amendment, approved by the
Commissioner of the Department of Health and Social Services or the
Commissioner\'s designee.

## Nondisclosure and Confidentiality {#nondisclosure-and-confidentiality .3.0}

Contractor agrees that all confidential information shall be used only
for purposes of providing the deliverables and performing the services
specified herein and shall not disseminate or allow dissemination of
confidential information except as provided for in this section. The
contractor shall hold as confidential and will use reasonable care
(including both facility physical security and electronic security) to
prevent unauthorized access by, storage, disclosure, publication,
dissemination to and/or use by third parties of, the confidential
information. "Reasonable care" means compliance by the contractor with
all applicable federal and state law, including the Social Security Act
and HIPAA. The contractor must promptly notify the state in writing if
it becomes aware of any storage, disclosure, loss, unauthorized access
to or use of the confidential information.

Confidential information, as used herein, means any data, files,
software, information or materials (whether prepared by the state or its
agents or advisors) in oral, electronic, tangible or intangible form and
however stored, compiled or memorialized that is classified confidential
as defined by State of Alaska classification and categorization
guidelines provided by the state to the contractor or a contractor agent
or otherwise made available to the contractor or a contractor agent in
connection with this contract, or acquired, obtained or learned by the
contractor or a contractor agent in the performance of this contract.
Examples of confidential information include, but are not limited to:
technology infrastructure, architecture, financial data, trade secrets,
equipment specifications, user lists, passwords, research data, and
technology data (infrastructure, architecture, operating systems,
security tools, IP addresses, etc.).

If confidential information is requested to be disclosed by the
contractor pursuant to a request received by a third party and such
disclosure of the confidential information is required under applicable
state or federal law, regulation, governmental or regulatory authority,
the contractor may disclose the confidential information after providing
the state with written notice of the requested disclosure ( to the
extent such notice to the state is permitted by applicable law) and
giving the state opportunity to review the request. If the contractor
receives no objection from the state, it may release the confidential
information within 30 days. Notice of the requested disclosure of
confidential information by the contractor must be provided to the state
within a reasonable time after the contractor's receipt of notice of the
requested disclosure and, upon request of the state, shall seek to
obtain legal protection from the release of the confidential
information.

The following information shall not be considered confidential
information: information previously known to be public information when
received from the other party; information freely available to the
general public; information which now is or hereafter becomes publicly
known by other than a breach of confidentiality hereof; or information
which is disclosed by a party pursuant to subpoena or other legal
process and which as a result becomes lawfully obtainable by the general
public.

## Indemnification {#indemnification .3.0}

The contractor shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the
contracting agency from and against any claim of, or liability for
error, omission or negligent act of the contractor under this agreement.
The contractor shall not be required to indemnify the contracting agency
for a claim of, or liability for, the independent negligence of the
contracting agency. If there is a claim of, or liability for, the joint
negligent error or omission of the contractor and the independent
negligence of the contracting agency, the indemnification and hold
harmless obligation shall be apportioned on a comparative fault basis.
"Contractor" and "contracting agency", as used within this and the
following article, include the employees, agents and other contractors
who are directly responsible, respectively, to each. The term
"independent negligence" is negligence other than in the contracting
agency's selection, administration, monitoring, or controlling of the
contractor and in approving or accepting the contractor's work.

## Insurance Requirements {#insurance-requirements .3.0}

Without limiting contractor\'s indemnification, it is agreed that
contractor shall purchase at its own expense and maintain in force at
all times during the performance of services under this agreement the
policies of insurance identified in Appendix B of the Standard Agreement
Template (Attached in Section 8). Where specific limits are shown, it is
understood that they shall be the minimum acceptable limits. If the
contractor\'s policy contains higher limits, the state shall be entitled
to coverage to the extent of such higher limits.

Certificates of Insurance must be furnished to the procurement officer
prior to beginning work and must provide for a notice of cancellation,
non-renewal, or material change of conditions in accordance with policy
provisions. Failure to furnish satisfactory evidence of insurance or
lapse of the policy is a material breach of this contract and shall be
grounds for termination of the contractor\'s services. All insurance
policies shall comply with and be issued by insurers licensed to
transact the business of insurance under AS 21.

## Termination For Default {#termination-for-default .3.0}

The Project Director, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in
whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the State. In the
absence of a breach of contract by the contractor, the State is liable
only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this
contract for services rendered before the effective date of termination.

#  Proposal Format and Content

## Proposal Format and Content

In preparing a proposal response, all narrative portions should be
straightforward, detailed, and precise. Do not simply restate or
paraphrase information in this RFP. The Department of Health and Social
Services will determine the responsiveness of a proposal by its quality,
not its volume or packaging.

The state discourages overly lengthy and costly proposals, with
proposals of thirty (30) or fewer pages encouraged. The thirty (30) page
limit does not include the cost proposal or appendices.

For the state to evaluate proposals fairly and completely, offerors must
follow the format set out in this RFP and provide all information
requested.

## Introduction {#introduction .6.0}

Proposals must include the complete name and address of offeror's firm
and the name, email address, and telephone number of the person the
state should contact regarding the proposal.

Proposals must confirm that the offeror will comply with all provisions
in this RFP. Proposals must be signed by a company officer empowered to
bind the company. An offeror\'s failure to include these items in the
proposals may cause the proposal to be determined to be non-responsive
and the proposal may be rejected. Introduction is included in the page
limit.

## technical UNDERSTANDING and approach {#technical-understanding-and-approach .6.0}

Succinctly describe level of knowledge, technical expertise and overall
understanding of the responsibilities as set forth in Section 3: Scope
of Work & Deliverables. This is also an opportunity to discuss, either
in the written proposal or during the verbal presentation, any technical
risks or opportunities. Technical Understanding and Approach is included
in the page limit.

## project management approach {#project-management-approach .6.0}

Offerors should plan to discuss, in their written proposal and/or during
verbal presentations, the following areas of project management:

-   Project Coordination -- Describe how you will manage the necessary
    coordination of the different stakeholder groups both within the
    state and within your teams. How will you handle team communication,
    meeting scheduling, and day to day information sharing. How do you
    plan to coordinate both the agile ceremonies needed for new work, as
    well as the support ticket process with the existing helpdesk team
    and systems.

-   Risk Management -- Discuss how the identification, classification,
    mitigation and documentation of risks would be addressed.

-   Issue Management -- Discuss how issues will be identified, addressed
    or escalated as needed.

-   Testing -- Describe your philosophy of testing, and how you would
    work with the state technical support teams to integrate into the
    shared CI/CD pipeline. Describe how you envision incorporating user
    testing.

Project Management Approach is included in the page limit.

## Approach to user INTERFACE and user experience design {#approach-to-user-interface-and-user-experience-design .6.0}

Proposals must contain information that describes how you will perform
user experience and user interface design as a part of the overall user
research. The proposal should also contain information about how this
research will be translated into relevant user stories and ultimately
into working software. We expect that for any user facing system
changes, there will need to be some amount of user research and design.

Approach to User Interface and User Experience Design is included in the
page limit.

## staffing Approach {#staffing-approach .6.0}

Offerors should provide a staffing approach that describes your
understanding of the responsibilities and details the number or
personnel by skill level/labor category needed to satisfy Section 3.01:
Scope of Work as well as Section 3.04 Personnel.

At a minimum, in this section, provide:

-   Description of your staffing methodology based on your understanding
    of the responsibilities;

-   A breakdown of labor categories, including the title, number of
    personnel, and hours; and

-   A list of Key Personnel by name, title, contact information,
    proposed duties and roles, and resumes for each proposed Key
    Personnel in accordance with Section 3.04: Personnel. Resumes should
    include a description of the experience and capability for all Key
    Personnel proposed for the offeror's project team. Resumes should
    also address the individual's technical background, education, work
    experience, and accomplishments related to the activities described
    in this RFP. The proposal of any key personnel not currently
    employed by the offeror or teaming partners shall be accompanied by
    letters of intent signed by proposed Key Personnel.

The staffing approach is included as part of your page limitation;
however, resumes and letters of intent are not included in the page
limitation.

## Similar Experience and Qualifications {#similar-experience-and-qualifications .6.0}

The offeror must describe how they fully meet the minimum qualifications
and personnel criteria identified in Sections 1.04 and 3.04.

Offerors must also provide a narrative description of the organization
of the project team and a personnel roster that identifies lines of
authority. For each identified Key Staff member who will work on the
contract, please provide the following:

-   Title and identification of the work this individual will be
    responsible for

-   Resume and specifically related work experience.

## Verbal Presentation {#verbal-presentation .6.0}

[]{#_verbal_presentation .anchor}Responsive offerors will be invited to
participate in a verbal presentation to be evaluated. The verbal
presentation will consist of a short demo and unstructured question and
answer session. The entire verbal presentation will take place remotely
via video chat and/or teleconference.

  No.   Agenda Item                             Maximum Time
  ----- --------------------------------------- -------------------------
  1     Introductions                           Approximately 5 minutes
  2     Open Technical Session Including Demo   90 minutes
  3     Closing Remarks                         5 minutes

During the open technical session, the Offeror will respond to the
State's questions related to the technical aspects of the Offeror's
proposal. We strongly prefer a demonstration of a similar application
built on like technology. This application can be a working prototype if
a production application is not available for demo. This could include a
short overview of an application that is built in JAVA and running on
IBM WebSphere, or changes to an application that is already running on a
similar technology stack. Of special note would be a demonstration of
code management processes where multiple teams are working on a single
code base including tools, testing, and process control. We are not
interested in a demo or overview of an eligibility system that does not
share similar technology and does not demonstrate the team's ability to
modify and maintain the State of Alaska Eligibility System. At this time
the State of Alaska is not interested in a full system replacement and
does not intend to award this RFP to do so.

Introductions will be used solely for introducing team member's names
and roles on both the State and vendor teams. Time for introductions
will not be allocated to business development purposes.

Although the technical factors are identified in the RFP, the core
questions are not listed there. Offerors must be prepared to answer
questions about the technical aspects of their proposal. The goal of
these presentations is to assess the technical abilities of the proposed
Key Personnel and further elaborate on their proposed technical approach
described in their written proposal to accomplish the objectives of this
task.

This part of the verbal presentations will not exceed 90 minutes. The
Procurement Officer will strictly enforce this time limit on all
presentations. There will be no follow-up session for further questions
after this part of the presentation.

**Presentation date and time**

The State will schedule the date and time of the verbal presentations
with each Offeror after the solicitation closing date and receiving each
Offeror's quote submission. The State reserves the right to reschedule
any Offeror's verbal presentations date at the discretion of the
procurement officer.

**Presentation location**

Verbal Presentations will take place via video chat, though audio may be
substituted as needed. The State will coordinate and set up the meeting
space accordingly (providing dial-in information or links using a tool
such as WebEx, Zoom or MS Teams).

**Presentation participants**

Proposed Key Personnel must participate in the verbal presentation.
Otherwise, the Offeror will be considered non-responsive and excluded
from further consideration.

Offerors may include as many participants as are necessary. Offerors
should note that the State will be asking technical questions during the
verbal presentation. Participants will also be asked questions related
to project management (section 4.04).

All proposed Key Personnel currently employed by the Offeror or its
teaming partners must attend the session - the State is most interested
in hearing from staff who will have a direct role in completing the
tasks.

After the presentations, vendors must email the meeting organizers the
names of everyone who attended.

## Cost Proposal {#cost-proposal .6.0}

Offerors must complete the Cost Proposal template provided in Section 8:
Attachments. Cost proposals must include an itemized list of all direct
and indirect costs associated with the performance of the contract,
including, but not limited to, total number of hours at various hourly
rates, direct expenses, payroll, travel, supplies, overhead assigned to
each person working on the project, and percentage of each person\'s
time devoted to the project.

**The completed cost proposal, including the proposed budget, along with
any reference to pricing, is to be excluded from the body of the
offeror's proposal.**

Instead, it should accompany the proposal in a separate, sealed envelope
if mailing proposal, or as a separate PDF if submitting via email.
Failure to comply with this requirement may result in a proposal being
rejected as non-responsive.

## Evaluation Criteria {#evaluation-criteria .6.0}

All proposals will be reviewed to determine if they are responsive.
Proposals determined to be responsive will be evaluated using the
criterion that is set out in Section 5: Evaluation Criteria and
Contractor Selection.

An evaluation may not be based on discrimination due to the race,
religion, color, national origin, sex, age, marital status, pregnancy,
parenthood, disability, or political affiliation of the offeror.

#  Evaluation Criteria and Contractor Selection

#  General Process Information

## Informal DeBriefing {#informal-debriefing .2.02}

When the contract is completed, an informal debriefing may be performed
at the discretion of the project director. If performed, the scope of
the debriefing will be limited to the work performed by the contractor.

## Alaska Business License and Other Required Licenses {#alaska-business-license-and-other-required-licenses .2.02}

Prior to the award of a contract, an offeror must hold a valid Alaska
business license. Offerors should contact the Department of Commerce,
Community and Economic Development, Division of Corporations, Business,
and Professional Licensing, PO Box 110806, Juneau, Alaska 99811-0806,
for information on these licenses. Website:
<https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/cbpl/BusinessLicensing.aspx>.

Acceptable evidence that the offeror possesses an Alaska business
license may consist of any one of the following:

-   copy of a valid Alaska business license;

-   certification on the proposal that the offeror has a valid Alaska
    business license and has included the license number in the
    proposal;

    Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game,

-   liquor licenses issued by Alaska Dept. of Revenue for alcohol sales
    only,

-   insurance licenses issued by Alaska Dept. of Commerce, Community and
    Economic Development - Division of Insurance, or

-   mining licenses issued by Alaska Dept. of Revenue.

Prior to the deadline for receipt of proposals, all offerors must hold
any other necessary applicable professional licenses required by Alaska
Statute.

## Clarification of Offers {#clarification-of-offers .2.02}

In order to determine if a proposal is reasonably susceptible for award,
communications by the procurement officer or the proposal evaluation
committee (PEC) are permitted with an offeror to clarify uncertainties
or eliminate confusion concerning the contents of a proposal.
Clarifications may not result in a material or substantive change to the
proposal. The evaluation by the procurement officer or the PEC may be
adjusted as a result of a clarification under this section.

## Discussions with Offerors

The State may conduct discussions with offerors in accordance with AS
36.30.240 and 2 AAC 12.290. The purpose of these discussions will be to
ensure full understanding of the requirements of the RFP and proposal.
Discussions will be limited to specific sections of the RFP or proposal
identified by the procurement officer. Discussions will only be held
with offerors who have submitted a proposal deemed reasonably
susceptible for award by the procurement officer. Discussions, if held,
will be after initial evaluation of proposals by the procurement officer
or the PEC. If modifications are made as a result of these discussions,
they will be put in writing. Following discussions, the procurement
officer may set a time for best and final proposal submissions from
those offerors with whom discussions were held. Proposals may be
reevaluated after receipt of best and final proposal submissions.

If an offeror does not submit a best and final proposal or a notice of
withdrawal, the offeror's immediate previous proposal is considered the
offeror's best and final proposal.

Offerors with a disability needing accommodation should contact the
procurement officer prior to the date set for discussions so that
reasonable accommodation can be made. Any oral modification of a
proposal must be reduced to writing by the offeror.

## Evaluation of Proposals

The procurement officer, or an evaluation committee made up of at least
three state employees or public officials, will evaluate proposals. The
evaluation will be based solely on the evaluation factors set out in
Section 5: Evaluation Criteria and Contractor Selection.

After receipt of proposals, if there is a need for any substantial
clarification or material change in the RFP, an amendment will be
issued. The amendment will incorporate the clarification or change, and
a new date and time established for new or amended proposals.
Evaluations may be adjusted as a result of receiving new or amended
proposals.

## Contract Negotiation {#contract-negotiation .2.02}

After final evaluation, the procurement officer may negotiate with the
offeror of the highest-ranked proposal. Negotiations, if held, shall be
within the scope of the request for proposals and limited to those items
which would not have an effect on the ranking of proposals. If the
highest-ranked offeror fails to provide necessary information for
negotiations in a timely manner, or fails to negotiate in good faith,
the state may terminate negotiations and negotiate with the offeror of
the next highest-ranked proposal. If contract negotiations are
commenced, they may be held in person, telephonically, or via video
conference. If the contract negotiations take place in person in Alaska,
the offeror will be responsible for their travel and per diem expenses.

## Failure to Negotiate

If the selected offeror:

-   fails to provide the information required to begin negotiations in a
    timely manner; or

-   fails to negotiate in good faith; or

-   indicates they cannot perform the contract within the budgeted funds
    available for the project; or

-   if the offeror and the state, after a good faith effort, simply
    cannot come to terms,

the state may terminate negotiations with the offeror initially selected
and commence negotiations with the next highest ranked offeror.

## Offeror Notification of Selection

After the completion of contract negotiation, the procurement officer
will issue a written Notice of Intent to Award (NOIA) and send copies to
all offerors who submitted proposals. The NOIA will set out the names of
all offerors and identify the offeror selected for award.

## Protest

AS 36.30.560 provides that an interested party may protest the content
of the RFP.

An interested party is defined in 2 AAC 12.990(a) (7) as \"an actual or
prospective bidder or offeror whose economic interest might be affected
substantially and directly by the issuance of a contract solicitation,
the award of a contract, or the failure to award a contract.\"

If an interested party wishes to protest the content of a solicitation,
the protest must be received, in writing, by the procurement officer at
least ten days prior to the deadline for receipt of proposals.

AS 36.30.560 also provides that an interested party may protest the
award of a contract or the proposed award of a contract.

If an offeror wishes to protest the award of a contract or the proposed
award of a contract, the protest must be received, in writing, by the
procurement officer within ten days after the date the Notice of Intent
to Award the contract is issued.

A protester must have submitted a proposal in order to have sufficient
standing to protest the proposed award of a contract. Protests must
include the following information:

-   the name, address, and telephone number of the protester;

-   the signature of the protester or the protester\'s representative;

-   identification of the contracting agency and the solicitation or
    contract at issue;

-   a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds of the protest
    including copies of relevant documents; and the form of relief
    requested.

The procurement officer will issue a written response to the protest.
The response will set out the procurement officer\'s decision and
contain the basis of the decision within the statutory time limit in AS
36.30.580. A copy of the decision will be furnished to the protester by
certified mail, fax or another method that provides evidence of receipt.

All offerors will be notified of any protest. The review of protests,
decisions of the procurement officer, appeals, and hearings, will be
conducted in accordance with the State Procurement Code (AS 36.30),
Article 8 \"Legal and Contractual Remedies."

## Formula Used to Convert Cost to Points {#formula-used-to-convert-cost-to-points .2.02}

The distribution of points based on cost will be determined as set out
in 2 AAC 12.260(c). The lowest cost proposal will receive the maximum
number of points allocated to cost. The point allocations for cost on
the other proposals will be determined using the formula:

*\[(Price of Lowest Cost Proposal) x (Maximum Points for Cost)\] ÷ (Cost
of Each Higher Priced Proposal)\]*

## Examples: Converting Cost to Points 

**Formula Used to Convert Cost to Points**

**[[Step 1]{.ul}]{.smallcaps}**

List all proposal prices.

> Offeror \#1 \$40,000\
> Offeror \#2 \$42,750\
> Offeror \#3 \$47,500

**[[Step 2]{.ul}]{.smallcaps}**

In this example, the RFP allotted 40% of the available 100 points to

#  General Legal Information

## Standard Contract Provisions {#standard-contract-provisions .3.0}

The contractor will be required to sign and submit the State\'s Standard
Agreement Form for Professional Services Contracts (including all
associated appendices). This form is attached in Section 8: Attachments,
for your review. The contractor must comply with all contract provisions
set out in this attachment. No alteration of these provisions will be
permitted without prior written approval from the Department of Law.
Objections to any of the provisions in Appendix A must be set out in the
offeror's proposal in a separate document. Please include the following
information with any change that you are proposing:

1.  Identify the provision the offeror takes exception with.

2.  Identify why the provision is unjust, unreasonable, etc.

3.  Identify exactly what suggested changes should be made.

## Qualified Offerors {#qualified-offerors .3.0}

Per 2 AAC 12.875, unless provided for otherwise in the RFP, to qualify
as an offeror for award of a contract issued under AS 36.30, the offeror
must:

1)  Add value in the contract by actually performing, controlling,
    managing, or supervising the services to be provided; or

2)  Be in the business of selling and have actually sold on a regular
    basis the supplies that are the subject of the RFP.

If the offeror leases services or supplies or acts as a broker or agency
in providing the services or supplies in order to meet these
requirements, the procurement officer may not accept the offeror as a
qualified offeror under AS 36.30.

## Proposal as a Part of the Contract {#proposal-as-a-part-of-the-contract .3.0}

Part or all of this RFP and the successful proposal may be incorporated
into the contract.

## Additional Terms and Conditions {#additional-terms-and-conditions .3.0}

The State reserves the right to add terms and conditions during contract
negotiations. These terms and conditions will be within the scope of the
RFP and will not affect the proposal evaluations.

## Human Trafficking

By signature on their proposal, the offeror certifies that the offeror
is not established and headquartered or incorporated and headquartered
in a country recognized as Tier 3 in the most recent United States
Department of State's Trafficking in Persons Report.

The most recent United States Department of State's Trafficking in
Persons Report can be found at the following website:
<https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/>

Failure to comply with this requirement will cause the state to reject
the proposal as non-responsive or cancel the contract.

## Right of Rejection

Offerors must comply with all of the terms of the RFP, the State
Procurement Code (AS 36.30), and all applicable local, state, and
federal laws, codes, and regulations. The procurement officer may reject
any proposal that does not comply with all of the material and
substantial terms, conditions, and performance requirements of the RFP.

Offerors may not qualify the proposal nor restrict the rights of the
state. If an offeror does so, the procurement officer may determine the
proposal to be a non-responsive counter-offer and the proposal may be
rejected.

Minor informalities may be waived by the procurement officer. These may
include informalities that:

-   do not affect responsiveness;

-   are merely a matter of form or format;

-   do not change the relative standing or otherwise prejudice other
    offers;

-   do not change the meaning or scope of the RFP;

-   are trivial, negligible, or immaterial in nature;

-   do not reflect a material change in the work; or

-   do not constitute a substantial reservation against a requirement or
    provision.

The state reserves the right to refrain from making an award if it
determines that to be in its best interest.

**A proposal from a debarred or suspended offeror shall be rejected.**

## State not Responsible for Preparation Costs

The State will not pay any cost associated with the preparation,
submittal, presentation, or evaluation of any proposal.

## Disclosure of Proposal Contents

All proposals and other material submitted become the property of the
State of Alaska and may be returned only at the state\'s option. AS
40.25.110 requires public records to be open to reasonable inspection.
All proposal information, including detailed price and cost information,
will be held in confidence during the evaluation process and prior to
the time a Notice of Intent to Award is issued. Thereafter, proposals
will become public information.

Trade secrets and other proprietary data contained in proposals may be
held confidential if the offeror requests, in writing, that the
procurement officer does so, and if the procurement officer agrees, in
writing, to do so. The offeror's request must be included with the
proposal, must clearly identify the information they wish to be held
confidential, and include a statement that sets out the reasons for
confidentiality. Unless the procurement officer agrees in writing to
hold the requested information confidential, that information will also
become public after the Notice of Intent to Award is issued.

## Assignment

Per 2 AAC 12.480, the contractor may not transfer or assign any portion
of the contract without prior written approval from the procurement
officer. Proposals that are conditioned upon the state's approval of an
assignment will be rejected as non-responsive.

## Disputes

A contract resulting from this RFP is governed by the laws of the State
of Alaska. If the contractor has a claim arising in connection with the
agreement that it cannot resolve with the state by mutual agreement, it
shall pursue the claim, if at all, in accordance with the provisions of
AS 36.30.620 -- AS 36.30.632. To the extent not otherwise governed by
the preceding, the claim shall be brought only in the Superior Court of
the State of Alaska and not elsewhere.

## Severability

If any provision of the contract or agreement is declared by a court to
be illegal or in conflict with any law, the validity of the remaining
terms and provisions will not be affected; and, the rights and
obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced as if the
contract did not contain the particular provision held to be invalid.

## Supplemental Terms and Conditions {#supplemental-terms-and-conditions .2.02}

Proposals must comply with Section 7.06: Right of Rejection. However, if
the state fails to identify or detect supplemental terms or conditions
that conflict with those contained in this RFP or that diminish the
state\'s rights under any contract resulting from the RFP, the term(s)
or condition(s) will be considered null and void.

After award of contract:

-   if conflict arises between a supplemental term or condition included
    in the proposal and a term or condition of the RFP, the term or
    condition of the RFP will prevail; and

-   if the state\'s rights would be diminished as a result of
    application of a supplemental term or condition included in the
    proposal, the supplemental term or condition will be considered null
    and void.

## Solicitation Advertising

Public notice has been provided in accordance with 2 AAC 12.220.

## Federally Imposed TaRiffs

Changes in price (increase or decrease) resulting directly from a new or
updated federal tariff, excise tax, or duty, imposed after contract
award may be adjusted during the contract period or before delivery into
the United States via contract amendment.

-   **Notification of Changes:** The contractor must promptly notify the
    procurement officer in writing of any new, increased, or decreased
    Federal excise tax or duty that may result in either an increase or
    decrease in the contact price and shall take appropriate action as
    directed by the procurement officer.

-   **After-imposed or Increased Taxes and Duties:** Any federal excise
    tax or duty for goods or services covered by this contract that was
    exempted or excluded on the contract award date but later imposed on
    the contractor during the contract period, as the result of
    legislative, judicial, or administrative action may result in a
    price increase provided:

    a.  The tax or duty takes effect after the contract award date and
        isn't otherwise addressed by the contract;

    b.  The contractor warrants, in writing, that no amount of the newly
        imposed federal excise tax or duty or rate increase was included
        in the contract price, as a contingency or otherwise.

-   **After-relieved or Decreased Taxes and Duties:** The contract price
    shall be decreased by the amount of any decrease in federal excise
    tax or duty for goods or services under the contract, except social
    security or other employment
    [taxes](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=e7c3de2c69ecf724736be4cfdf5433ce&term_occur=7&term_src=Title:48:Chapter:1:Subchapter:H:Part:52:Subpart:52.2:52.229-3),
    that the contractor is required to pay or bear, or does not obtain a
    refund of, through the contractor\'s fault, negligence, or failure
    to follow instructions of the procurement officer.

-   **State's Ability to Make Changes:** The state reserves the right to
    request verification of Federal excise tax or duty amounts on goods
    or services covered by this contract and increase or decrease the
    contract price accordingly.

-   **Price Change Threshold:** No adjustment shall be made in the
    contract price under this clause unless the amount of the adjustment
    exceeds \$250.

## Attachment 1 -- Cost Proposal

The purpose of the cost proposal format below is to allow Offerors to
submit pricing in a consistent manner that the State can evaluate and
score. The State has provided the desired rate type multipliers, in an
annualized format, to provide a mechanism to correlate costs to the
anticipated budget. These estimates are not a guarantee of services or
payment, which will be paid via the contract, for actual services
provided.

Proposals will be evaluated on the Total Project Cost, indicated at the
bottom of this sheet. Total Project Cost in excess of \$18,000,000.00
(fully executed initial 2-year period with 3 optional annual renewal
years) will cause the proposal to be considered non-responsive and be
rejected.

Please enter your costs in the spaces provided below for each role,
material, and any additional costs that will be incurred. All costs
proposed in each section below must include all anticipated expenses,
including scheduling, communication, implementation, and documentation.
No additional costs may be billed to the contract without prior approval
by the State, via Contract Amendment.

## Attachment 4 - Certification Regarding Debarment

**Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility\
and Voluntary Exclusion Lower Tier Covered Transactions**

Expenditures from this contract may involve federal funds. The U.S.
Department of Labor requires all state agencies that are expending
federal funds to have a certification filed by the contractor that they
have not been debarred or suspended from doing business with the federal
government. Certification regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility
and Voluntary Exclusion Lower Tier Covered Transactions must be signed
along with the contract documents.

This certification is required by the regulations implementing Executive
Order 12549, Debarment and Suspension, 29 CFR Part 98, Section 98.510,
Participant\'s responsibilities. The regulations were published as Part
VII of the May 26, 1988 Federal Register (pages 19160-19211).

> **Before completing this certification, read the instructions on the
> following page,**
>
> **which are an integral part of the certification.**

1.  The prospective recipient of Federal assistance funds certifies, by
    submission of this bid, that neither it nor its principals are
    presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared
    ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this
    transaction by any Federal department or agency.

2.  Where the prospective recipient of Federal assistance funds is
    unable to certify to any of the Statements in this certification,
    such prospective participant shall attach an explanation to this
    Proposal.

**Instructions for Certification**

1.  By signing and submitting this Proposal, the prospective recipient
    of Federal assistance

funds is providing the certification as set out below.

2.  The certification in this class is a material representation of fact
    upon which reliance was placed when this transaction was entered
    into. If it is later determined that the prospective recipient of
    Federal assistance funds knowingly rendered an erroneous
    certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
    Federal Government, the Department of Labor (DOL) may pursue
    available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.

3.  The prospective recipient of Federal assistance funds shall provide
    immediate written notice to the person to whom this Proposal is
    submitted if at any time the prospective recipient of Federal
    assistance funds learns that its certification was erroneous when
    submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed
    circumstances.

4.  The terms \"covered transaction,\" \"debarred,\" \"suspended,\"
    \"ineligible,\" \"lower tier covered transaction,\" \"participant,\"
    \"person,\" \"primary covered transaction,\" \"principal,\"
    \"Proposal,\" and \"voluntarily excluded,\" as used in this clause,
    have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage sections
    of rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You may contact the
    person to which this Proposal is submitted for assistance in
    obtaining a copy of those regulations.

5.  The prospective recipient of Federal assistance funds agrees by
    submitting this Proposal that, should the proposed covered
    transaction be entered into, it shall not knowingly enter into any
    lower tier covered transaction with a person who is debarred,
    suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from
    participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the
    DOL.

6.  The prospective recipient of Federal assistance funds further agrees
    by submitting this Proposal that it will include the clause titled
    \"Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and
    Voluntary Exclusion - Lower Tier Covered Transactions,\" without
    modification, in all lower tier covered transactions and in all
    solicitations for lower tier covered transactions.

7.  A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification
    of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered transaction
    that it is not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily
    excluded from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the
    certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and
    frequency by which it determines the eligibility of its principals.
    Each participant may but is not required to check the List of
    Parties Excluded from Procurement or Non-procurement Programs.

8.  Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require
    establishment of a system of records in order to render in good
    faith the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and
    information of a participant is not required to exceed that which is
    normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of
    business dealings.

9.  Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 5 of these
    instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly
    enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is
    suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from
    participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies
    available to the Federal Government, the DOL may pursue available
    remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.

absence of a breach of contract by the contractor, the State is liable
only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this
contract for services rendered before the effective date of termination.

**Article 6. No Assignment or Delegation.**

The contractor may not assign or delegate this contract, or any part of
it, or any right to any of the money to be paid under it, except with
the written consent of the Project Director and the Agency Head.

**Article 7. No Additional Work or Material.**

No claim for additional services, not specifically provided in this

State in the performance of this contract.

**Article 9. Payment of Taxes.**

As a condition of performance of this contract, the contractor shall pay
all federal, State, and local taxes incurred by the contractor and shall
require their payment by any Subcontractor or any other persons in the
performance of this contract. Satisfactory performance of this paragraph

**Article 10. Ownership of Documents.**

All designs, drawings, specifications, notes, artwork, and other work
developed in the performance of this agreement are produced for hire and
remain the sole property of the State of Alaska and may be used by the
State for any other purpose without additional compensation to the
contractor. The contractor agrees not to assert any rights and not to
establish any claim under the design patent or copyright laws.
Nevertheless, if the contractor does mark such documents with a
statement suggesting they are trademarked, copyrighted, or otherwise
protected against the State's unencumbered use or distribution, the
contractor agrees that this paragraph supersedes any such statement and
renders it void. The contractor, for a period of three years after final

otherwise directed by the Project Director, the contractor may retain
copies of all the materials.

concerning this contract shall be brought only in the Superior Court of
the State of Alaska and not elsewhere.

Unless specifically amended and approved by the Department of Law, the
terms of this contract supersede any provisions the contractor may seek
to add. The contractor may not add additional or different terms to this
contract; AS 45.02.207(b)(1). The contractor specifically acknowledges
and agrees that, among other things, provisions in any documents it
seeks to append hereto that purport to (1) waive the State of Alaska's
sovereign immunity, (2) impose indemnification obligations on the State
of Alaska, or (3) limit liability of the contractor for acts of
contractor negligence, are expressly superseded by this contract and are
void.

**Article 13. Officials Not to Benefit.**

Contractor must comply with all applicable federal or State laws
regulating ethical conduct of public officers and employees.

**Article 14. Covenant Against Contingent Fees.**

The contractor warrants that no person or agency has been employed or
retained to solicit or secure this contract upon an agreement or
understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage or contingent fee
except employees or agencies maintained by the contractor for the
purpose of securing business. For the breach or violation of this
warranty, the State may terminate this contract without liability or in
its discretion deduct from the contract price or consideration the full
amount of the commission, percentage, brokerage or contingent fee.

**Article 15. Compliance.**

In the performance of this contract, the contractor must comply with all
applicable federal, state, and borough regulations, codes, and laws, and
be liable for all required insurance, licenses, permits and bonds.

**Article 16. Force Majeure:**

The parties to this contract are not liable for the consequences of any
failure to perform, or default in performing, any of their obligations
under this Agreement, if that failure or default is caused by any
unforeseeable Force Majeure, beyond the control of, and without the
fault or negligence of, the respective party. For the purposes of this
Agreement, Force Majeure will mean war (whether declared or not);
revolution; invasion; insurrection; riot; civil commotion; sabotage;
military or usurped power; lightning; explosion; fire; storm; drought;
flood; earthquake; epidemic; quarantine; strikes; acts or restraints of
governmental authorities affecting the project or directly or indirectly
prohibiting or restricting the furnishing or use of materials or labor
required; inability to secure materials, machinery, equipment or labor
because of priority, allocation or other regulations of any governmental
authorities.

**Appendix B^2^**

**Indemnity and Insurance**

**Article 1. Indemnification**

The Contractor shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the
contracting agency from and against any claim of, or liability for
error, omission or negligent act of the Contractor under this agreement.
The Contractor shall not be required to indemnify the contracting agency
for a claim of, or liability for, the independent negligence of the
contracting agency. If there is a claim of, or liability for, the joint
negligent error or omission of the Contractor and the independent
negligence of the Contracting agency, the indemnification and hold
harmless obligation shall be apportioned on a comparative fault basis.
"Contractor" and "Contracting agency", as used within this and the
following article, include the employees, agents and other contractors
who are directly responsible, respectively, to each. The term
"independent negligence" is negligence other than in the Contracting
agency's selection, administration, monitoring, or controlling of the
Contractor and in approving or accepting the Contractor's work.

**Article 2. Insurance**

Without limiting contractor\'s indemnification, it is agreed that
contractor shall purchase at its own expense and maintain in force at
all times during the performance of services under this agreement the
following policies of insurance. Where specific limits are shown, it is
understood that they shall be the minimum acceptable limits. If the
contractor\'s policy contains higher limits, the state shall be entitled
to coverage to the extent of such higher limits. Certificates of
Insurance must be furnished to the contracting officer prior to
beginning work and must provide for a notice of cancellation,
non-renewal, or material change of conditions in accordance with policy
provisions. Failure to furnish satisfactory evidence of insurance or
lapse of the policy is a material breach of this contract and shall be
grounds for termination of the contractor\'s services. All insurance
policies shall comply with and be issued by insurers licensed to

ARIES SUPPORT

INTRODUCTION

This Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) has been developed to evaluate
contractor actions while implementing the Scope of Work (SOW). It is
designed to provide an effective method of monitoring contractor
performance for each listed objective on the Performance Requirements
Matrix. It also provides a systematic method to evaluate the services
the contractor is required to furnish.

STANDARD

The contractor is responsible for management and quality control actions
to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Procurement Officer
(PO) and ARIES Technical Support Team is quality assurance to ensure
contract standards are achieved. The contractor shall perform all work
required in a satisfactory manner in accordance with the requirements of
the RFP. The Contractor shall notify the Product Manager for appropriate
action if it is likely that the contractor will not achieve successful
delivery of the software code or support activities in accordance with
the performance objectives and acceptable quality levels (AQLs)
identified below.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS MATRIX

The Technical Support Team and PO will evaluate the performance
objectives reflected below by reviews and acceptance of work products
and services. As indicated, the Product Team and PO will assess progress
towards the final delivered software code. Note that the performance
requirements listed below are required for the final deliverables.
However, the sprints and incremental delivery of code will be assessed
by the Department of Health and Social Services to ensure that the
contractor is on a path to successful final delivery. Deliverable or
Required Services Performance Standard(s):

PROCEDURES

The Product Team and PO, along with the product owner, will inspect all
tasks required by the contract to ensure contractor compliance with the
contract requirements at the conclusion of each sprint, which shall have
a length of two weeks or less, unless agreed upon by the vendor and
product team. The Product Team will create/identify the repositor(y/ies)
needed for executing the contract and provide brief documentation on
their purpose. If the contractor identifies a need for a change in the
repositories, they will submit a request to the product team. The
product team will review, discuss as needed, and resolve the request, as
agreed.

Delivery of all software assets will occur by pull request from the
contractor's repository to the appropriate Alaska repository. If
inspection results are satisfactory, the pull request will be merged;
otherwise, deficiencies will be noted in the pull request or through
issues as described below. The Product Team and PO may find the delivery
satisfactory even though further work is required, provided that the
specific requirements of the sprint are met.

Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing, the contractor shall deliver
research-related records to DHSS in accordance with the previously
agreed upon design research plan. The design research plan shall be
delivered during the first sprint.

At the conclusion of each sprint, the PO and Product Team, along with
the 18F Product Lead and the product owner, will review the completed
user stories and related functionality to ensure compliance with
acceptance criteria and requirements. Incomplete or inadequate code and
user stories will be noted in a mutually agreed-upon issue tracker with
links to each issue shared with the PO. The contractor may respond in
that tracker as appropriate, addressing the accuracy and validity of the
defect as well as any planned corrective action (if not already noted).
All clarifications and changes to the scope agreed upon in the issue
tracker will be updated as revised acceptance criteria in the incomplete
backlog items as part of the backlog grooming process. The contractor
team will discuss and document actions to prevent recurrence in the
sprint retrospectives.

At the conclusion of the period of performance, a similar procedure will
be followed to document discrepancies and to assess overall performance.

If any of the services do not conform to the contract requirements, the
PO may require the contractor to perform the services again in
conformity with contract requirements. Any user stories that are not
accepted must be completed in the next sprint, unless the product owner
and TTS product manager agree to move it to a later sprint. The PO shall
not certify satisfactory performance for the contract until all defects
have been corrected. When the defects in services cannot be corrected by
re-performance, the State may:

1.  Require the contractor to take necessary action to ensure that
    future performance conforms to contract requirements; and,

2.  Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the
    services performed. The Product Manager and PO will maintain a
    complete quality assurance file. The file will contain copies of all
    reports, evaluations, recommendations, and any actions relating to
    the State's performance of the quality assurance function, including
    originals of all quality monitoring checklists. All such records
    will be retained for the life of the contract.

ACCEPTANCE OF SERVICES

Acceptance of services shall be based upon compliance with performance
standards described in the PWS and monitoring procedures described in
this QAP. Before approving/certifying any contractor invoices, the PO
will verify that all invoiced services have been performed in compliance
with contract requirements. The PO shall not certify satisfactory
performance for the contract until all defects have been corrected.
