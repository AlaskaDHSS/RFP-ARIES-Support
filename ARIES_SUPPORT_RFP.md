# Section 1 Introduction & Instructions

## Sec. 1.01 Purpose of the RFP

Alaska DHSS DPA is searching for a partner to support the ongoing
maintenance of the public assistance eligibility system. This system
currently processes eligibility for MAGI Medicaid but is growing to
support all existing public assistance programs. This system has over
400 internal users, an externally facing self-service portal, a
connection to the federally facilitated healthcare marketplace, and
currently issues MAGI Medicaid for over 200,000 Alaskans. An interested
partner will work closely with State of Alaska technical and business
staff to ensure the eligibility system is:

-   Performing correctly and efficiently

-   Meeting applicable security requirements

-   Compliant with Federal and state regulations

-   Is available for staff use

-   Appropriately documented

## Sec. 1.02 Budget

The Department of Health and Social Services, Division of Public
Assistance (DPA) has a maximum budget of \$7,200,000.00 for completion
of this initial contract period (two (2) years). The State may choose to
exercise three (3) annual renewal options anticipated to be valued at
\$3,600,000.00 annually. If the full five (5) year term is executed the
value is estimated to be \$18,000,000.00. Approval or continuation of a
contract or any additionally identified services is contingent upon
legislative appropriation.

Proposals priced at more than the maximum budget for the initial
contract period (\$7,200,000.00) or higher than the total possible
estimated contract amount (\$18,000,000.00) will be considered
non-responsive.

## Sec. 1.03 Deadline for Receipt of Proposals

Proposals must be received no later than 2:00 pm prevailing Alaska Time
on TBD.

Late proposals or amendments will be disqualified and not opened or
accepted for evaluation.

## Sec. 1.04 Minimum Qualifications

In order for offers to be considered responsive, offerors must meet the
following minimum prior experience requirements. Please ensure start and
end dates (month and year) are indicated, and that experience is
detailed sufficiently to ensure verification of all aspects of the
minimums below.


- Contractor must have a minimum of three (3) years' experience in 
the last five (5) years, conducting health or human services    
system support operations services. This experience must include 
maintenance and updates of an enterprise technology system       

- These updates must include configuration updates and software development updates                                              

- Demonstrated experience with similar technologies at an enterprise scale                                                 

An offeror's failure to meet these minimum prior experience
requirements will cause their proposal to be considered non-responsive
and rejected.

## Sec. 1.05 Required Review

Offerors should carefully review this solicitation for defects and
questionable or objectionable material. Comments concerning defects and
questionable or objectionable material should be made in writing and
received by the procurement officer at least ten days before the
deadline for receipt of proposals. This will allow time for the issuance
of any necessary amendments. It will also help prevent the opening of a
defective proposal and exposure of offeror's proposals upon which award
could not be made.

## Sec. 1.06 Questions Prior to Deadline for Receipt of Proposals

Questions or comments regarding this RFP shall be submitted as issues
within this RFP's GitHub repository no later than 12 noon on TBD, to
allow the State sufficient time to respond. All questions and comments
will be publicly available. Please subscribe to the repository if your
firm would like updates about changes and comments. Questions or
comments received after the required deadline may not be answered.

Questions may also be submitted in writing to the Procurement Officer,
who will post them as issues with the GitHub repository listed above.

Two types of questions generally arise. One may be answered by directing
the questioner to a specific section of the RFP. Other questions may be
more complex and may require a written amendment to the RFP. The
procurement officer will make that decision.

#  Section 2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

## Sec. 2.01 Background Information

Alaska Administrative Code (AAC) 7 designates the Department of Health
and Social Services (DHSS) as having responsibility for administering
the Food Stamp, Adult Public Assistance, Medical Assistance, Heating
Assistance, Alaska Temporary Assistance and General Relief programs.

As a part of this designation, the DHSS Division of Public Assistance
(DPA) is charged with determining eligibility for each of the programs
based on State and Federal regulation.

To perform this work, DPA uses several technical systems. These include
a legacy mainframe system, as well as a modern MAGI Medicaid
determination platform. This system is used by over 400 eligibility
technicians, administrative staff, and management personnel within DPA.
In addition to these users there are multiple community partners that
access the system to assist in the public assistance program
administration.

The MAGI Medicaid eligibility system is based on an IBM WebSphere software platform utilizing Microsoft Servers currently hosted on the State of Alaska virtual infrastructure. This virtual infrastructure is maintained by the Office of Information Technology under the Department of Administration. DHSS is currently responsible for the applications that run on this infrastructure. 

The current Azure infrastructure, in limited use, is managed by DHSS. 

The system communicates with multiple Federal and state partners to transfer information and documentation.


DPA utilizes modern software delivery methods. We are user centric and
integrate security and privacy into all our maintenance and improvement
work. More information about our approach can be found at
<https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/EIS-Modernization/>

Offerors should review this repo for information that will be critical
in constructing a quality proposal.

Of specific interest are:

<https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/EIS-Modernization/blob/master/how-we-work.md>

<https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/EIS-Modernization/blob/master/tech-strategy.md>

This solicitation is for the support of the new modern eligibility platform. This platform currently contains MAGI Medicaid eligibility determination as well as a person search application. The eligibility product roadmap linked above within the how we work documentation contains plans to move all public assistance programs into one modern eligibility platform using a modular iterative approach. This support contract is for the express purpose of supporting this new modern integrated eligibility platform and all its components. The roadmap as well as the scope in section 3.01 list out those components.

with the Alaska technical support team.

We Manage our projects using a mix of traditionally agile processes.

These include sprint ceremonies:

-   Sprint planning

-   Sprint grooming

-   Sprint review including product demo

-   Sprint retrospective

We manage the work in each sprint using a modified Scrum process in
Microsoft AzureDevOps and Microsoft Team Foundation Server. Our
processes also include security throughout the effort, so we typically
refer to our work as DevSecOps. You can find more information about our
processes in our GitHub repo at [How We
Work](https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/EIS-Modernization/blob/master/how-we-work.md).


A successful vendor will have experience working with clients using
modern software development approaches. These approaches must include
cross-functional teams that use human-centered design, build with modern
technology stacks, and use an iterative, agile approach to continuously
deliver working software to their clients.

**DAILY OPERATIONS**

Daily operations will be managed by the contractor's project manager but
coordinated to and communicated with the Alaska technical support team.
They may include:

Daily standup via video

Chat communications via MS Teams

Manage and update user stories + workflow tasks in shared project
management platform (TFS or AzureDevOps)

</table>




**DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS**

Code deliverables shall be submitted via Git PRs to the ARIES
TFS/AzureDevOps repository. A copy of any document deliverables shall be
submitted to the Alaska technical team.

**INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF SERVICES**

All periodic reports and deliverables shall be inspected, tested (where
applicable), reviewed, and accepted by the Alaska technical team, prior
to sprint conclusion and deployment to the staging and production
environments.

Only the Alaska technical support team has the authority to inspect,
accept, or reject all deliverables.

Acceptance of services and deliverables will be based on the criteria
laid out in the [quality assurance plan](https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/RFP-ARIES-Support/blob/main/Attachment%2007%20QAP.md).

**SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION**

The Contractor shall consult with the Alaska technical team to determine
what is appropriate, effective, and essential for system documentation.
The State requires, at a minimum, that the contractor will generate
comprehensive and complete documentation, both within the code itself,
within the source code version control system (e.g., through proper use
of descriptive commit messages, issue tracking, pull requests, etc.),
and as appropriate, in separate documentation, provide artifacts, and
create new user stories based on each sprint.

We typically house documentation in TFS or AzureDevOps either in the
built-in wiki, or as part of a repository. This allows the documents to
be versioned and controlled. We expect that the selected vendor will
create and update documentation using these standards where appropriate.

**QUALITY ASSURANCE**

The contractor shall comply with the acceptable quality levels (AQL) as
described in the attached quality assurance plan [QAP](https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/RFP-ARIES-Support/blob/main/Attachment%2007%20QAP.md).

## Sec. 3.07 Contract Type

This contract will be a time and materials contract with a do not exceed
amount.

## Sec. 3.08 Proposed Payment Procedures

The state will make payments based on a negotiated payment schedule.
Each billing must consist of an invoice and progress report. No payment
will be made until the progress report and invoice has been approved by
the project director.

## Sec. 3.09 Prompt Payment For State Purchases

The state is eligible to receive a **5%** discount for all invoices paid
within **15** business days from the date of receipt of the commodities
or services and/or a correct invoice, whichever is later. The discount
shall be taken on the full invoice amount. The state shall consider
payment being made as either the date a printed warrant is issued or the
date an electronic funds transfer (EFT) is initiated.

## Sec. 3.10 Contract Payment

No payment will be made until the contract is approved by the
Commissioner of the Department of Health and Social Services or the
Commissioner\'s designee. Under no conditions will the state be liable
for the payment of any interest charges associated with the cost of the
contract. The state is not responsible for and will not pay local,
state, or federal taxes. All costs associated with the contract must be
stated in U.S. currency.

Any single contract payment of \$1 million or higher must be accepted by
the contractor via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).

## Sec. 3.11 Location of Work

The location(s) the work is to be performed, completed, and managed is
at the discretion of the contractor as long as the location complies
with the requirements listed below. The state will not provide workspace
for the contractor. The contractor must provide its own workspace.

We anticipate much of this work to be performed remotely with close
collaboration between the project team via digital communication
methods. There may be some occasions where an on-site visit is required,
but those will be the exception rather than the rule.

In the event where an on-site presence is requested, the following State
Approved Travel Guidelines apply

The State will cover costs associated with travel per the criteria
listed below. Expenses above these criteria must be approved in advance
by the Project Director.

-   **Air Travel**: copies of receipts and boarding passes for flights
    must be submitted with the invoice. The State will reimburse for
    coach travel only.

-   **Hotel**: copies of original hotel receipts at commercial
    facilities must be submitted with the invoice. Actual lodging
    expenses that exceed \$200 room rate per night, excluding taxes,
    must be approved in advance by the Program Manager.

-   **Rental Car**: copies of the rental car receipt and agreement must
    be submitted with the invoice. Rental should be for a mid-size or
    less car (unless approved in advance) and the rental period is to
    cover the business travel period only.

-   **Ground Transportation**: between the Contractor's home and the
    airport, and the destination airport and hotel; via airport shuttle,
    courtesy van, or taxi service.

-   **Per Diem**: the maximum amount for food and all other travel
    related incidentals in Alaska is \$60 per day, per person.

**Note**: Costs of parking violations will not be reimbursed

To facilitate this method of delivery and partnership it is critical
that a successful vendor align with the State of Alaska time zone. The
vendor's team must ensure their agile ceremonies are conducted at times
that are consistent with the State of Alaska's normal business hours
(8:00AM--5:00PM Alaska Standard Time). As a rule, staff should be
available during these times.

**Performance of Work Within United States**

By signature on their proposal, the offeror certifies that all services
provided under this contract by the contractor and all subcontractors
shall be performed in the United States.

If the offeror cannot certify that all work will be performed in the
United States, the offeror must contact the procurement officer in
writing to request a waiver at least 10 days prior to the deadline for
receipt of proposals.

The request must include a detailed description of the portion of work
that will be performed outside the United States, where, by whom, and
the reason the waiver is necessary.

Failure to comply with these requirements may cause the state to reject
the proposal as non-responsive or cancel the contract.

## Sec. 3.12 Subcontractors

Subcontractors may be used to perform work under this contract. If an
offeror intends to use subcontractors, the offeror must identify in the
proposal the names of the subcontractors and the portions of the work
the subcontractors will perform.

Subcontractor experience shall not be considered in determining whether
the offeror meets the requirements set forth in Sec. [1.04](#sec-104-minimum-qualifications)

If a proposal with subcontractors is selected, the offeror must provide
the following information concerning each prospective subcontractor
within five working days from the date of the state\'s request:

-   complete name of the subcontractor;

-   complete address of the subcontractor;

-   type of work the subcontractor will be performing;

-   percentage of work the subcontractor will be providing;

-   evidence that the subcontractor holds a valid Alaska business
    license; and

-   a written statement signed by each proposed subcontractor that
    clearly verifies that the subcontractor is committed to render the
    services required by the contract.

An offeror\'s failure to provide this information, within the time set,
may cause the state to consider their proposal non-responsive and reject
it. The substitution of one subcontractor for another may be made only
at the discretion and prior written approval of the project director.

Note that if the subcontractor will not be performing work within
Alaska, they will not be required to hold an Alaska business license.

## Sec. 3.13 Joint Ventures

Joint ventures will not be allowed.

## Sec. 3.14 Right to Inspect Place of Business

At reasonable times, the state may inspect those areas of the
contractor\'s place of business that are related to the performance of a
contract. If the state makes such an inspection, the contractor must
provide reasonable assistance.

## Sec. 3.15 Contract Personnel

Any change of the key personnel or subcontractors named in the proposal
must be approved, in advance and in writing, by the project director.
Personnel changes that are not approved by the state may be grounds for
the state to terminate the contract.

## Sec. 3.16 Inspection & Modification - Reimbursement For Unacceptable Deliverables

The contractor is responsible for the completion of all work set out in
the contract. All work is subject to inspection, evaluation, and
approval by the project director. The state may employ all reasonable
means to ensure that the work is progressing and being performed in
compliance with the contract. The project director may instruct the
contractor to make corrections or modifications if needed in order to
accomplish the contract's intent. The contractor will not unreasonably
withhold such changes.

Substantial failure of the contractor to perform the contract may cause
the state to terminate the contract. In this event, the state may
require the contractor to reimburse monies paid (based on the identified
portion of unacceptable work received) and may seek associated damages.

## Sec. 3.17 Contract Changes - Unanticipated Amendments

During the course of this contract, the contractor may be required to
perform additional work. That work will be within the general scope of
the initial contract. When additional work is required, the project
director will provide the contractor a written description of the
additional work and request the contractor to submit a firm time
schedule for accomplishing the additional work and a firm price for the
additional work. Cost and pricing data must be provided to justify the
cost of such amendments per AS 36.30.400.

The contractor will not commence additional work until the project
director has secured any required state approvals necessary for the
amendment and issued a written contract amendment, approved by the
Commissioner of the Department of Health and Social Services or the
Commissioner\'s designee.

## Sec. 3.18 Nondisclosure and Confidentiality

Contractor agrees that all confidential information shall be used only
for purposes of providing the deliverables and performing the services
specified herein and shall not disseminate or allow dissemination of
confidential information except as provided for in this section. The
contractor shall hold as confidential and will use reasonable care
(including both facility physical security and electronic security) to
prevent unauthorized access by, storage, disclosure, publication,
dissemination to and/or use by third parties of, the confidential
information. "Reasonable care" means compliance by the contractor with
all applicable federal and state law, including the Social Security Act
and HIPAA. The contractor must promptly notify the state in writing if
it becomes aware of any storage, disclosure, loss, unauthorized access
to or use of the confidential information.

Confidential information, as used herein, means any data, files,
software, information or materials (whether prepared by the state or its
agents or advisors) in oral, electronic, tangible or intangible form and
however stored, compiled or memorialized that is classified confidential
as defined by State of Alaska classification and categorization
guidelines provided by the state to the contractor or a contractor agent
or otherwise made available to the contractor or a contractor agent in
connection with this contract, or acquired, obtained or learned by the
contractor or a contractor agent in the performance of this contract.
Examples of confidential information include, but are not limited to:
technology infrastructure, architecture, financial data, trade secrets,
equipment specifications, user lists, passwords, research data, and
technology data (infrastructure, architecture, operating systems,
security tools, IP addresses, etc.).

If confidential information is requested to be disclosed by the
contractor pursuant to a request received by a third party and such
disclosure of the confidential information is required under applicable
state or federal law, regulation, governmental or regulatory authority,
the contractor may disclose the confidential information after providing
the state with written notice of the requested disclosure ( to the
extent such notice to the state is permitted by applicable law) and
giving the state opportunity to review the request. If the contractor
receives no objection from the state, it may release the confidential
information within 30 days. Notice of the requested disclosure of
confidential information by the contractor must be provided to the state
within a reasonable time after the contractor's receipt of notice of the
requested disclosure and, upon request of the state, shall seek to
obtain legal protection from the release of the confidential
information.

The following information shall not be considered confidential
information: information previously known to be public information when
received from the other party; information freely available to the
general public; information which now is or hereafter becomes publicly
known by other than a breach of confidentiality hereof; or information
which is disclosed by a party pursuant to subpoena or other legal
process and which as a result becomes lawfully obtainable by the general
public.

## Sec. 3.19 Indemnification

The contractor shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the
contracting agency from and against any claim of, or liability for
error, omission or negligent act of the contractor under this agreement.
The contractor shall not be required to indemnify the contracting agency
for a claim of, or liability for, the independent negligence of the
contracting agency. If there is a claim of, or liability for, the joint
negligent error or omission of the contractor and the independent
negligence of the contracting agency, the indemnification and hold
harmless obligation shall be apportioned on a comparative fault basis.
"Contractor" and "contracting agency", as used within this and the
following article, include the employees, agents and other contractors
who are directly responsible, respectively, to each. The term
"independent negligence" is negligence other than in the contracting
agency's selection, administration, monitoring, or controlling of the
contractor and in approving or accepting the contractor's work.

## Sec. 3.20 Insurance Requirements

Without limiting contractor\'s indemnification, it is agreed that
contractor shall purchase at its own expense and maintain in force at
all times during the performance of services under this agreement the
policies of insurance identified in Appendix B of the Standard Agreement
Template (Attached in Section 8). Where specific limits are shown, it is
understood that they shall be the minimum acceptable limits. If the
contractor\'s policy contains higher limits, the state shall be entitled
to coverage to the extent of such higher limits.

Certificates of Insurance must be furnished to the procurement officer
prior to beginning work and must provide for a notice of cancellation,
non-renewal, or material change of conditions in accordance with policy
provisions. Failure to furnish satisfactory evidence of insurance or
lapse of the policy is a material breach of this contract and shall be
grounds for termination of the contractor\'s services. All insurance
policies shall comply with and be issued by insurers licensed to
transact the business of insurance under AS 21.

## Sec. 3.21 Termination For Default

The Project Director, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in
whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the State. In the
absence of a breach of contract by the contractor, the State is liable
only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this
contract for services rendered before the effective date of termination.

    experience, and accomplishments related to the activities described
    in this RFP. The proposal of any key personnel not currently
    employed by the offeror or teaming partners shall be accompanied by
    letters of intent signed by proposed Key Personnel.

The staffing approach is included as part of your page limitation;
however, resumes and letters of intent are not included in the page
limitation.

## Sec. 4.07 Similar Experience and Qualifications

The offeror must describe how they fully meet the minimum qualifications
and personnel criteria identified in Sections 1.04 and 3.04.

Offerors must also provide a narrative description of the organization
of the project team and a personnel roster that identifies lines of
authority. For each identified Key Staff member who will work on the
contract, please provide the following:

-   Title and identification of the work this individual will be
    responsible for

-   Resume and specifically related work experience.

Information about similar experience and qualifications is included as part of your page limitation.

## Sec. 4.08 Verbal Presentation

Responsive offerors will be invited to participate in a verbal presentation to be evaluated. The verbal presentation will consist of a short demo and unstructured question and answer session. The entire verbal presentation will take place remotely via video chat and/or teleconference.

##### Table 2 Verbal Presentation
**Agenda Item** | **Maximum Time** 
--- | ---
Introductions | Approximately 5 minutes
Open Technical Session Including Demo | 90 minutes
Question and Answer Session | 30 minutes
Closing Remarks | 5 minutes


During the open technical session, the Offeror will respond to the
State's questions related to the technical aspects of the Offeror's
proposal. We strongly prefer a demonstration of a similar application
built on like technology. This application can be a working prototype if
a production application is not available for demo. This could include a
short overview of an application that is built in JAVA and running on
IBM WebSphere, or changes to an application that is already running on a
similar technology stack. Of special note would be a demonstration of
code management processes where multiple teams are working on a single
code base including tools, testing, and process control. We are not
interested in a demo or overview of an eligibility system that does not
share similar technology and does not demonstrate the team's ability to
modify and maintain the State of Alaska Eligibility System. At this time
the State of Alaska is not interested in a full system replacement and
does not intend to award this RFP to do so.

Introductions will be used solely for introducing team member's names
and roles on both the State and vendor teams. Time for introductions
will not be allocated to business development purposes.

Although the technical factors are identified in the RFP, the core
questions are not listed there. Offerors must be prepared to answer
questions about the technical aspects of their proposal. The goal of
these presentations is to assess the technical abilities of the proposed
Key Personnel and further elaborate on their proposed technical approach
described in their written proposal to accomplish the objectives of this
task.

This part of the verbal presentations will not exceed 90 minutes. The
Procurement Officer will strictly enforce this time limit on all
presentations. There will be no follow-up session for further questions
after this part of the presentation.

**Presentation date and time**

The State will schedule the date and time of the verbal presentations
with each Offeror after the solicitation closing date and receiving each
Offeror's quote submission. The State reserves the right to reschedule
any Offeror's verbal presentations date at the discretion of the
procurement officer.

**Presentation location**

Verbal Presentations will take place via video chat, though audio may be
substituted as needed. The State will coordinate and set up the meeting
space accordingly (providing dial-in information or links using a tool
such as WebEx, Zoom or MS Teams).

**Presentation participants**

Proposed Key Personnel must participate in the verbal presentation.
Otherwise, the Offeror will be considered non-responsive and excluded
from further consideration.

Offerors may include as many participants as are necessary. Offerors
should note that the State will be asking technical questions during the
verbal presentation. Participants will also be asked questions related
to project management (section 4.04).

All proposed Key Personnel currently employed by the Offeror or its
teaming partners must attend the session - the State is most interested
in hearing from staff who will have a direct role in completing the
tasks.

After the presentations, vendors must email the meeting organizers the
names of everyone who attended.

## Sec. 4.09 Cost Proposal

Offerors must complete the Cost Proposal template provided in Section 8:
Attachments. Cost proposals must include an itemized list of all direct
and indirect costs associated with the performance of the contract,
including, but not limited to, total number of hours at various hourly
rates, direct expenses, payroll, travel, supplies, overhead assigned to
each person working on the project, and percentage of each person\'s
time devoted to the project.

**The completed cost proposal, including the proposed budget, along with
any reference to pricing, is to be excluded from the body of the
offeror's proposal.**

Instead, it should accompany the proposal in a separate, sealed envelope
if mailing proposal, or as a separate PDF if submitting via email.
Failure to comply with this requirement may result in a proposal being
rejected as non-responsive.

## Sec. 4.10 Evaluation Criteria

All proposals will be reviewed to determine if they are responsive.
Proposals determined to be responsive will be evaluated using the
criterion that is set out in Section 5: Evaluation Criteria and
Contractor Selection.

An evaluation may not be based on discrimination due to the race,
religion, color, national origin, sex, age, marital status, pregnancy,
parenthood, disability, or political affiliation of the offeror.

#  Section 6. GENERAL PROCESS INFORMATION

## Sec. 6.01 Informal DeBriefing

When the contract is completed, an informal debriefing may be performed
at the discretion of the project director. If performed, the scope of
the debriefing will be limited to the work performed by the contractor.

## Sec. 6.02 Alaska Business License and Other Required Licenses

Prior to the award of a contract, an offeror must hold a valid Alaska
business license. Offerors should contact the Department of Commerce,
Community and Economic Development, Division of Corporations, Business,
and Professional Licensing, PO Box 110806, Juneau, Alaska 99811-0806,
for information on these licenses. Website:
<https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/cbpl/BusinessLicensing.aspx>.

Acceptable evidence that the offeror possesses an Alaska business
license may consist of any one of the following:

-   copy of a valid Alaska business license;

-   certification on the proposal that the offeror has a valid Alaska
    business license and has included the license number in the
    proposal;

-   a canceled check for the Alaska business license fee;

-   a copy of the Alaska business license application with a receipt
    stamp from the state\'s occupational licensing office; or

-   a sworn and notarized statement that the offeror has applied and
    paid for the Alaska business license.

You are not required to hold a valid Alaska business license at the time

are offering services or supplies under that specific line of business:

-   fisheries business licenses issued by Alaska Dept. of Revenue or
    Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game,

-   liquor licenses issued by Alaska Dept. of Revenue for alcohol sales
    only,

-   insurance licenses issued by Alaska Dept. of Commerce, Community and
    Economic Development - Division of Insurance, or

-   mining licenses issued by Alaska Dept. of Revenue.

Prior to the deadline for receipt of proposals, all offerors must hold
any other necessary applicable professional licenses required by Alaska
Statute.

## Sec. 6.03 Clarification of Offers

In order to determine if a proposal is reasonably susceptible for award,
communications by the procurement officer or the proposal evaluation
committee (PEC) are permitted with an offeror to clarify uncertainties
or eliminate confusion concerning the contents of a proposal.
Clarifications may not result in a material or substantive change to the
proposal. The evaluation by the procurement officer or the PEC may be
adjusted as a result of a clarification under this section.

## Sec. 6.04 Discussions with Offerors

The State may conduct discussions with offerors in accordance with AS
36.30.240 and 2 AAC 12.290. The purpose of these discussions will be to
ensure full understanding of the requirements of the RFP and proposal.
Discussions will be limited to specific sections of the RFP or proposal
identified by the procurement officer. Discussions will only be held
with offerors who have submitted a proposal deemed reasonably
susceptible for award by the procurement officer. Discussions, if held,
will be after initial evaluation of proposals by the procurement officer
or the PEC. If modifications are made as a result of these discussions,
they will be put in writing. Following discussions, the procurement
officer may set a time for best and final proposal submissions from
those offerors with whom discussions were held. Proposals may be
reevaluated after receipt of best and final proposal submissions.

If an offeror does not submit a best and final proposal or a notice of
withdrawal, the offeror's immediate previous proposal is considered the
offeror's best and final proposal.

Offerors with a disability needing accommodation should contact the
procurement officer prior to the date set for discussions so that
reasonable accommodation can be made. Any oral modification of a
proposal must be reduced to writing by the offeror.

## Sec. 6.05 Evaluation of Proposals

The procurement officer, or an evaluation committee made up of at least
three state employees or public officials, will evaluate proposals. The
evaluation will be based solely on the evaluation factors set out in
Section 5: Evaluation Criteria and Contractor Selection.

After receipt of proposals, if there is a need for any substantial
clarification or material change in the RFP, an amendment will be
issued. The amendment will incorporate the clarification or change, and
a new date and time established for new or amended proposals.
Evaluations may be adjusted as a result of receiving new or amended
proposals.

## Sec. 6.06 Contract Negotiation

After final evaluation, the procurement officer may negotiate with the
offeror of the highest-ranked proposal. Negotiations, if held, shall be
within the scope of the request for proposals and limited to those items
which would not have an effect on the ranking of proposals. If the
highest-ranked offeror fails to provide necessary information for
negotiations in a timely manner, or fails to negotiate in good faith,
the state may terminate negotiations and negotiate with the offeror of
the next highest-ranked proposal. If contract negotiations are
commenced, they may be held in person, telephonically, or via video
conference. If the contract negotiations take place in person in Alaska,
the offeror will be responsible for their travel and per diem expenses.

## Sec. 6.07 Failure to Negotiate

If the selected offeror:

-   fails to provide the information required to begin negotiations in a
    timely manner; or

-   fails to negotiate in good faith; or

-   indicates they cannot perform the contract within the budgeted funds
    available for the project; or

-   if the offeror and the state, after a good faith effort, simply
    cannot come to terms,

the state may terminate negotiations with the offeror initially selected
and commence negotiations with the next highest ranked offeror.

## Sec. 6.08 Offeror Notification of Selection

After the completion of contract negotiation, the procurement officer
will issue a written Notice of Intent to Award (NOIA) and send copies to
all offerors who submitted proposals. The NOIA will set out the names of
all offerors and identify the offeror selected for award.

## Sec. 6.09 Protest

AS 36.30.560 provides that an interested party may protest the content
of the RFP.

An interested party is defined in 2 AAC 12.990(a) (7) as \"an actual or
prospective bidder or offeror whose economic interest might be affected
substantially and directly by the issuance of a contract solicitation,
the award of a contract, or the failure to award a contract.\"

If an interested party wishes to protest the content of a solicitation,
the protest must be received, in writing, by the procurement officer at
least ten days prior to the deadline for receipt of proposals.

AS 36.30.560 also provides that an interested party may protest the
award of a contract or the proposed award of a contract.

If an offeror wishes to protest the award of a contract or the proposed
award of a contract, the protest must be received, in writing, by the
procurement officer within ten days after the date the Notice of Intent
to Award the contract is issued.

A protester must have submitted a proposal in order to have sufficient
standing to protest the proposed award of a contract. Protests must
include the following information:

-   the name, address, and telephone number of the protester;

-   the signature of the protester or the protester\'s representative;

-   identification of the contracting agency and the solicitation or
    contract at issue;

-   a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds of the protest
    including copies of relevant documents; and the form of relief
    requested.

The procurement officer will issue a written response to the protest.
The response will set out the procurement officer\'s decision and
contain the basis of the decision within the statutory time limit in AS
36.30.580. A copy of the decision will be furnished to the protester by
certified mail, fax or another method that provides evidence of receipt.

All offerors will be notified of any protest. The review of protests,
decisions of the procurement officer, appeals, and hearings, will be
conducted in accordance with the State Procurement Code (AS 36.30),
Article 8 \"Legal and Contractual Remedies."

## Sec. 6.10 Formula Used to Convert Cost to Points

The distribution of points based on cost will be determined as set out
in 2 AAC 12.260(c). The lowest cost proposal will receive the maximum
number of points allocated to cost. The point allocations for cost on
the other proposals will be determined using the formula:

*\[(Price of Lowest Cost Proposal) x (Maximum Points for Cost)\] ÷ (Cost
of Each Higher Priced Proposal)\]*

## Sec. 6.11 Examples: Converting Cost to Points

**Formula Used to Convert Cost to Points**

**Step 1

List all proposal prices.

> Offeror \#1 \$40,000\
> Offeror \#2 \$42,750\
> Offeror \#3 \$47,500

**Step 2

In this example, the RFP allotted 40% of the available 100 points to
cost. This means that the lowest cost will receive the maximum number of
points.

> **Offeror \#1 receives 40 points.**
>
> The reason they receive that amount is because the lowest cost
> proposal, in this case \$40,000, receives the maximum number of points
> allocated to cost, 40 points.
>
> **Offeror \#2 receives 37.4 points.**
>
> \$40,000 lowest cost x 40 maximum points for cost = 1,600,000 ÷
> \$42,750 cost of proposal = **37.4**
>
> **Offeror \#3 receives 33.7 points.**
>
> \$40,000 lowest cost x 40 maximum points for cost = 1,600,000 ÷
> \$47,500 cost of proposal = **33.7**

#  Section 7. GENERAL LEGAL INFORMATION

## Sec. 7.01 Standard Contract Provisions

The contractor will be required to sign and submit the State\'s Standard
Agreement Form for Professional Services Contracts (including all
associated appendices). This form is attached in Section 8: Attachments,

    managing, or supervising the services to be provided; or

2)  Be in the business of selling and have actually sold on a regular
    basis the supplies that are the subject of the RFP.

If the offeror leases services or supplies or acts as a broker or agency

rejected.

Minor informalities may be waived by the procurement officer. These may
include informalities that:

-   do not affect responsiveness;

-   are merely a matter of form or format;

-   do not change the relative standing or otherwise prejudice other
    offers;

-   do not change the meaning or scope of the RFP;

-   are trivial, negligible, or immaterial in nature;

-   do not reflect a material change in the work; or

-   do not constitute a substantial reservation against a requirement or

## Sec. 7.07 State not Responsible for Preparation Costs

The State will not pay any cost associated with the preparation,
submittal, presentation, or evaluation of any proposal.

## Sec. 7.08 Disclosure of Proposal Contents

All proposals and other material submitted become the property of the

40.25.110 requires public records to be open to reasonable inspection.
All proposal information, including detailed price and cost information,
will be held in confidence during the evaluation process and prior to
the time a Notice of Intent to Award is issued. Thereafter, proposals
will become public information.

Trade secrets and other proprietary data contained in proposals may be
held confidential if the offeror requests, in writing, that the
procurement officer does so, and if the procurement officer agrees, in
writing, to do so. The offeror's request must be included with the
proposal, must clearly identify the information they wish to be held
confidential, and include a statement that sets out the reasons for
confidentiality. Unless the procurement officer agrees in writing to
hold the requested information confidential, that information will also
become public after the Notice of Intent to Award is issued.

## Sec. 7.09 Assignment

Per 2 AAC 12.480, the contractor may not transfer or assign any portion
of the contract without prior written approval from the procurement
officer. Proposals that are conditioned upon the state's approval of an
assignment will be rejected as non-responsive.

## Sec. 7.10 Disputes

A contract resulting from this RFP is governed by the laws of the State
of Alaska. If the contractor has a claim arising in connection with the
agreement that it cannot resolve with the state by mutual agreement, it

AS 36.30.620 -- AS 36.30.632. To the extent not otherwise governed by
the preceding, the claim shall be brought only in the Superior Court of
the State of Alaska and not elsewhere.

## Sec. 7.11 Severability

If any provision of the contract or agreement is declared by a court to
be illegal or in conflict with any law, the validity of the remaining
terms and provisions will not be affected; and, the rights and
obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced as if the
contract did not contain the particular provision held to be invalid.

## Sec. 7.12 Supplemental Terms and Conditions

Proposals must comply with Section 7.06: Right of Rejection. However, if
the state fails to identify or detect supplemental terms or conditions
that conflict with those contained in this RFP or that diminish the
state\'s rights under any contract resulting from the RFP, the term(s)
or condition(s) will be considered null and void.

After award of contract:

-   if conflict arises between a supplemental term or condition included
    in the proposal and a term or condition of the RFP, the term or
    condition of the RFP will prevail; and

-   if the state\'s rights would be diminished as a result of
    application of a supplemental term or condition included in the
    proposal, the supplemental term or condition will be considered null
    and void.

## Sec. 7.13 Solicitation Advertising

Public notice has been provided in accordance with 2 AAC 12.220.

## Sec. 7.14 Federally Imposed Tariffs

Changes in price (increase or decrease) resulting directly from a new or

the United States via contract amendment.

-   **Notification of Changes:** The contractor must promptly notify the
    procurement officer in writing of any new, increased, or decreased
    Federal excise tax or duty that may result in either an increase or
    decrease in the contact price and shall take appropriate action as

-   **After-imposed or Increased Taxes and Duties:** Any federal excise
    tax or duty for goods or services covered by this contract that was
    exempted or excluded on the contract award date but later imposed on
    the contractor during the contract period, as the result of
    legislative, judicial, or administrative action may result in a
    price increase provided:

    a.  The tax or duty takes effect after the contract award date and
        isn't otherwise addressed by the contract;

    b.  The contractor warrants, in writing, that no amount of the newly
        imposed federal excise tax or duty or rate increase was included
        in the contract price, as a contingency or otherwise.

-   **After-relieved or Decreased Taxes and Duties:** The contract price
    shall be decreased by the amount of any decrease in federal excise
    tax or duty for goods or services under the contract, except social
    security or other employment
    [taxes](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=e7c3de2c69ecf724736be4cfdf5433ce&term_occur=7&term_src=Title:48:Chapter:1:Subchapter:H:Part:52:Subpart:52.2:52.229-3),
