# State of Alaska RFP for an Alaska Resources for Integrated Eligibility Services (ARIES) System Support Partner

## Instructions

This repository will be used to gather feedback on an expected upcoming RFP release from the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) Division of Public Assistance (DPA). We ask that you review the documents here, and provide feedback by opening an issue within this repository. 

When we are ready to release the official RFP it will be posted here in this repository and will also be listed in the official State of Alaska Vendor Self Service Portal https://iris-vss.alaska.gov/webapp/PRDVSS1X1/AltSelfService

## Important note about referenced documentation

You'll notice that we link to a number of working documents in our RFP and related materials.  Interested vendors should be aware that all of these documents are subject to change because Alaska is continuing to learn more as we continue prototyping and working with various elements of the existing system to build out our DevSecOps capabilities.  We encourage interested vendors to "Watch" what's going on in [the main DHSS Modernization repo](https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/acq-alaska-dhss-modernization) and in [the DevSecOps repo](https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/DevSecOpsMvp) to be aware of what we're learning.  However, we don't anticipate anything that we learn or change in this environment to alter how an interested vendor would staff up their proposed teams.  As discussed throughout the RFP, we are interested in vendors that are open to such changes without requiring a static set of requirements at the time of the RFP.

## Background

Alaska DHSS DPA is searching for a partner to support the ongoing
maintenance of the public assistance eligibility system. This system
currently processes eligibility for MAGI Medicaid but is growing to
support all existing public assistance programs. This system has over
400 internal users, an externally facing self-service portal, a
connection to the federally facilitated healthcare marketplace, and
currently issues MAGI Medicaid for over 200,000 Alaskans. An interested
partner will work closely with State of Alaska technical and business
staff to ensure the eligibility system is:

* Performing correctly and efficiently

* Meeting applicable security requirements

* Compliant with Federal and state regulations

* Available for staff use

* Appropriately documented
 
_Important note - Questions about this RFP should be [posted here](../../issues) - and not to the main DHSS project repo._

### What we're hoping to achieve as a result of this acquistion

* Support and maintain a stable security posture

* Promote efficient business operations for both the technical support teams as well as the DPA business units

* Proactively handle system planning and improvement

### How to respond

We've made every effort to allow for less burden in what we require from interested vendors.  Although the RFP might seem to be pretty extensive, we're asking for limited [tbd](1-Request-for-Proposals.md#section-5evaluation-criteria-and-contractor-selection) and believe we'll learn more about your team's approach and offer as part of your verbal presentation.  As discussed in the RFP, we see this presentation to be free flowing vs. formal so that our technical evaluation team can ask questions based on what they've read or heard from your team.

### Budget

We have a budget of $7,200,000.00 dollars for the initial contract period outlined in the RFP. Proposals priced at more than this amount will be considered non-responsive.  This will be a time and materials contract.

### Contract Term

This initial contract will last two years from the date of award - approximately Q1 2021 - Q4 2023. There are optional renewal periods outlined after the initial contract period.
